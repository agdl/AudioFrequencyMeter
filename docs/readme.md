# Audio Frequency Meter Library

This library allows an an Arduino based on SAMD architectures (all MKR boards, Nano 33 IoT and more) to sample an analog Input signal and get back its frequency. The analog pin to be used to sample the signal and the sample frequency can be chosen.

To use this library:

```
#include <AudioFrequencyMeter.h>
```
